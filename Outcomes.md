## Feedback

* Lack of documentation can make bug fixing very difficult

* It works well if you can use one of the stock examples but once you go off track it becomes very tricky

* Altair through Python is useful with good examples but using altair through R and reticulate can be buggy.

* Examples of how to use the R version of reticulate are there but the syntax can be obscured.
